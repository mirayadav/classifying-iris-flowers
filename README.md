# classifying iris flowers

Trained a logistic regression model using K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm (chosen after comparing accuracy, recall, and precision for 5 other algorithms) to classify iris flowers based on 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) with data from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/iris.csv. The model is then used to make an inference for the sample dataset from sample.csv (file can be modified by user). 

Based off of tutorial from: https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/.
